Name of monitor used:
SiteMonitor plugin in Jenkins

HAR File:
Simulates when a user gives correct credentials
click on login after credentials are correct


Gatling results:
we simulated an average of 30 users each second (4000 in total )on the server, trying to log in.
we can see on the graph that every user has good response times and the website is not crashing.
our guess why everything is "perfect" is because its a very small websites with no comlicated functionalties.
